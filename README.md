# AirBnB_clone

## HBNB - The Console
***
This repository contains the initial stage of a project to build a clone of the AirBnB website's command interpreter. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects including file storage management. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

## Command Interpreter
___
A command interpreter is the part of the operating system that takes commands on the command line from the user and executes them. The Shell is a good example.

To start the command interpreter, first clone the repo to your local machine, and run the console: 
`./console` Once running, the prompt will appear `(HBNB)`, and you can enter your command. With this command line interpreter, the user can create a new User, Place, State, or City, as well as retrieve an object from a file. The user may also update any of these attributes or destroy them.
